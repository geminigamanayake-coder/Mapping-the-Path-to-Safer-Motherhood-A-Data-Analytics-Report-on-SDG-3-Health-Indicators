# Maternal Health Analysis: SQL & Power BI Implementation

This project analyzes maternal health data to identify high-risk pregnancies and support proactive clinical decision-making. Using SQL Server for data preprocessing and Power BI for interactive visualization, the project evaluates key physiological indicators to uncover patterns associated with maternal risk levels.

The study demonstrates how structured data engineering and business intelligence tools can be applied in healthcare analytics to support safer motherhood and improved health outcomes.

## Project Overview

* Analyze maternal health indicators to identify high-risk pregnancies
* Examine relationships between physiological vitals and pregnancy risk levels
* Develop interactive dashboards to support proactive healthcare interventions
* Demonstrate practical application of SQL and Power BI in healthcare analytics

---

## Dataset

Source: Maternal Health Dataset (CSV format)

The dataset includes six primary physiological indicators:

* Maternal Age
* Systolic Blood Pressure (UpperBP)
* Diastolic Blood Pressure (LowerBP)
* Blood Glucose Levels (BS)
* Body Temperature
* Heart Rate

These variables were analyzed to determine correlations with categorized pregnancy risk levels (Low, Mid, High).

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Engineering (SQL Server)

All preprocessing was performed in SQL Server.

Key processes:

* Data cleaning and validation
* Handling missing and inconsistent values
* Structuring raw CSV data into relational format
* Data type standardization
* Aggregation queries for KPI calculations

Structured datasets were prepared for seamless integration into Power BI.

### 2. Data Visualization (Power BI)

Power BI was used to create an interactive dashboard featuring:

* Risk category distribution (Low, Mid, High)
* Donut charts for proportional analysis
* Scatter plots showing correlations between age and physiological vitals
* DAX measures for dynamic calculations (e.g., average systolic BP, risk percentage)
* Interactive filtering for exploratory analysis

The dashboard enables users to visually identify high-risk clusters and understand key contributing health indicators.

## Key Findings

* Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure strongly correlate with high-risk pregnancies
* Increased blood glucose levels are significant predictors of maternal risk
* Certain age groups exhibit higher concentrations of risk factors
* Risk distribution visuals highlight the proportion of high-risk cases within the dataset

These insights support targeted monitoring and proactive healthcare interventions.

---

## Limitations

* Analysis limited to physiological indicators only
* No socio-economic, environmental, or genetic variables included
* Historical dataset does not reflect real-time patient monitoring
* Risk classification is based on available dataset categories
